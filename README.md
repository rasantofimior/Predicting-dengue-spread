# Predicting-earthquakes
Final project BDML 2022


This is a repository for the Problem Set 1 from Big Data and Machine Learning for Applied Economics course at 2022 Fall. 

Thi repo contains the following folders:

- `document`: contains the final document in `pdf` format. Ideally, the document should pull figures and tables directly from the `views` folder. I've included a latex template I created for the Thesis Seminar. 
- `scripts`: contains all your scripts
- `stores`: contains all the data sets used. If files are "too big" for GitHub, include a document describing where people can access the data.
- `views`: contains all figures and tables
- `biblio`: contains the extra files and bibliography
